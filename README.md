This generator lets you scaffold your AngularJS/Wakanda website.

###EXPERIMENTAL

THIS IS AN ALPHA RELEASE, AND ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT IS ONGOING. THE GENERATOR/CONNECTOR ANGULAR-WAKANDA ARE UNSTABLE AND NOT FINAL AND SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION (WHATEVER THAT MEANS FOR YOU).

THE GENERATOR/CONNECTOR ANGULAR-WAKANDA ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

##Prerequisite

Of course you need node, but you will also need the following modules to get the generator (and its grunt scripts) running :

* bower (client dependencie) `npm install bower -g`
* grunt-cli (grunt command line) `npm install grunt-cli -g`
* yo (yeoman command line) `npm install yo -g`
* karma (test runner - optionnal) `npm install karma -g`

If you get into some troubles for the installation - see [notes](#notes) part.

##Usage

Install `generator-cordova-wakanda` :

```
npm install -g generator-cordova-wakanda
```

Go to your Wakanda project directory

```
cd MyWakandaSolution/MyWakandaProject
```

Run `yo cordova-wakanda`, optionally passing an app name (the app name of your cordova app) :

```
yo cordova-wakanda [app-name]
```

You will be asked a couple of questions like :

* The name of the folder you want to put all the usual yo angular scaffold
* Whether you want to use Sass/Compass or not
* Whether you want to use Bootstrap or not
* Which angular modules you whish to include

Example of output directory tree :

```
WakandaProjectFolder
├─┬ cordovaApp
  ├─┬ app
    ├── scripts
    ├── styles
    ├── index.html
  ├── bower.json
  ├── Gruntfile.js
  ├── node_modules
  ├── package.json
  ├── test
├── Gruntfile.js
├── node_modules
├── package.json
├── WebFolder
├── .gitignore
```
In result, you will have two levels of Gruntfile.js :

* The one at the root where you can call tasks like `grunt wakCopy`
* The one in your angularApp folder which contains exactly the same kind of tasks as you would expect from a regular Gruntfile.js made with `yo angular` like `grunt serve`, `grunt build` …

##Angular subgenerators available

In your `cordovaApp` folder, you can run any of the [official yeoman generator-angular subgenerators](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular/blob/master/readme.md#generators).

## Resources

* [angular-wakanda connector](https://github.com/Wakanda/bower-angular-wakanda)
* [Home page](http://www.wakanda.org/angular-wakanda/)

##Contributors

* If you don't have yo : `npm install -g yo`
* Clone the repo
* `npm install`
* If you already work with the genrator-angular-wakanda, you'll need to uninstall it : `npm uninstall generator-cordova-wakanda -g`
* In the repo directory : `npm link` (will let you use your local version of the generator)

##Notes

* If you have troubles installing modules, sometimes a `npm cache clean` can do the trick
* If you are behind a proxy that doesn't allow git:// urls (problems for the bower install), take a look at [this link](https://coderwall.com/p/sitezg)
